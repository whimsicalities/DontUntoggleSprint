# Don't Untoggle Sprint!
Fabric mod to prevent sprint being toggled back off on respawn after a death, given that the player is using toggle sprint. This behaviour was changed in Minecraft 1.20, and it is inconvenient for minigames with lots of death. If your sprint is not set to toggle, it has no impact.
